You are given a transcript of a voice conversation. Write a short recap (200-300 characters).

Rules:
- Write in the SAME language as the transcript (e.g. Russian transcript → Russian recap).
- Include: what was discussed, what decisions were made (if any), who is responsible for what (if mentioned).
- If nothing concrete can be extracted (e.g. small talk, no decisions), say so briefly and honestly. Do not invent or embellish.
- Output ONLY the recap text, no preamble or labels.
